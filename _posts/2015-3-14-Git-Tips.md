* Donot commit half-work to main branch.  For development activities, always create seperate branch and commit often in the branch. Once testing is done, commit to main branch. 
* Donot use Amend in published work (already pushed to server).  Doing so, the further commit push will be rejected by server.  Pulling from server to update local copy will result in merge conflict. 
* Have plugins for your editior/IDE to do code format automatically. This will reduces the unnecessary commits due to code formatting.
